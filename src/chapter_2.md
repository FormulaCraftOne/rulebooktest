# TEAM RULES

## Team Captains

At the beginning of the season, a number of team captains will be chosen. Team captains will be chosen based on skill and their ability to lead a team. Each team captain will be responsible for negotiating and recruiting other racers to their team, as well as creating their team name, color, identity, etc.

## Team Size

The largest a team can be is double the size of the smallest team. If for some reason, the smallest team loses a member and other teams are then at an illegal size because of this, they are allowed to keep the racers they already have signed. If a racer leaves a team of an illegal size, they will not be permitted to return until the maximum team size is increased again because the smallest team gained some members.

## Team Advisors

Each team is limited to 1 team advisor (TA). TAs will not count toward the team size limit. TAs can not drive in FC1 races unless they are also listed as a driver.
Team advisors along with anyone spotting or spectating the race must be in spectator mode during qualifying and the race if they are not well clear of the track (such as in the stands or in the pit boxes).
