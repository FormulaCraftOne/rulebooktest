Anyone will be able to make their own content regarding FC1 (consider linking the ABG discord in the description as well ;) FC1 does not endorse any individual’s content. Make sure if you are making content about or around FC1 that it follows whatever platform’s guidelines that it is going to be posted to/shared on.
